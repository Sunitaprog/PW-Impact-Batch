    "Q1. What is multithreading in python ? Why is it used ?Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "Ans. Multithreading refers to concurrently executing multiple threads by rapidly switching the control of the CPU between threads (called context switching). The Python Global Interpreter Lock limits one thread to run at a time even if the machine contains multiple processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python is a popular technique that enables multiple tasks to be executed simultaneously. In simple words, the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python multithreading facilitates sharing data space and resources of multiple threads with the main thread. It allows efficient and easy communication between the threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python multithreading enables efficient utilization of the resources as the threads share the data space and memory. Multithreading in Python allows the concurrent and parallel occurrence of various tasks. It causes a reduction in time consumption or response time, thereby increasing the performance\n",

    "Ans. Race Condition :\n",
    "Race conditions are a real problem in Python when using threads, even in the presence of the global interpreter lock (GIL). The refrain that there are no race conditions in Python because of the GIL is dangerously wrong.A race condition is a bug in concurrency programming.It is a failure case where the behavior of the program is dependent upon the order of execution by two or more threads. This means, the behavior of the program will not be predictable, possibly changing each time it is run.There are many types of race conditions, although a common type of race condition is when two or more threads attempt to change the same data variable.\n",
